Welcome to the LeagueApp!

Development:
- IDE: IntelliJ Community Edition.

Added modules:
- JUnit5 for unit tests
- Mockito for mocking in unit tests

Distribution:
- Used jpackage to build .dmg files, to enable easy installation of the built artefacts on Mac OS.

Installation instructions:
- Either build the jar or retrieve it via the .dmg installer (for Mac OS only) on email (because being executables they have not been committed to git)
- (Mac OS) If you have the .dmg, simply double-click the .dmg to run, and drag the app to the Applications folder.

Running instructions:
- <Path to application> <absolute path to the sample input file>. For example:
/Applications/LeagueApp.app/Contents/MacOS/LeagueApp /Users/diananyabongo/IdeaProjects/League/tst/testresources/InputScores.txt
- the example above uses the InputScores.txt file committed to git.
